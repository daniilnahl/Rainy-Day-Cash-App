# Rainy Day Cash App #
##Introduction##
This project was created to automate a manual process I wouldn't say I liked doing. This app automatizes tracking how much cash you have saved for a "Rainy Day". By "Rainy Day" I mean a situation where you get into some unexpected predicament and urgently need money to solve it. 
You go to your cash stash and ohh no, you don't remember how much you stashed away! This is where this app comes in. It will tell you how much you have saved up based on the transactions you have recorded. Other features of this app are recording, modifying, and deleting transactions, and sorting them in 
different types of orders. 
##Usage##
To use the Rainy Day Cash App, follow these steps:
1. Open the project in your favorite code editor.
2. Run the source code.
3. Use the project as desired.
