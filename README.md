# Rainy Day Cash App

## Introduction
The **Rainy Day Cash App** was created to automate a manual process I found tedious. This app helps track how much cash you've saved for a "Rainy Day", a situation where you face an unexpected financial need and urgently require money to solve it. 
Imagine going to your cash stash only to realize you can't remember how much you've saved. That's where this app steps in! It allows you to easily track how much you have saved based on your recorded transactions.
